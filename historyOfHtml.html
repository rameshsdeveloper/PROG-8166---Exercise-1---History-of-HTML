            <h2 class="fh2">Development</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
            researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
            hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That
            year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
            funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed
            "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</p>
        <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the
            Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple
            design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house
            Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
            still exist in HTML 4.</p>
